    "- Explanation of Results\r\n",

    "Example 2: \"()[]{}\" - Valid because all brackets are properly nested and matched.\r\n",
    "Example 3: \"(]\" - Invalid because the opening parenthesis is closed by a square bracket (wrong type).\r\n",

    "Let’s conduct a detailed data analysis of the provided Python code, which processes health-related datasets (cardio_alco.csv, cardio_base.csv) and COVID-19 data (covid_data.csv) to derive various insights. The analysis will cover the data loading, preprocessing, and each query (Q1-Q12), interpreting the potential findings based on typical dataset characteristics. Since the actual data isn’t provided, I’ll base the analysis on the code’s intent, common patterns in such datasets, and logical inferences as of 04:35 PM -03 on Sunday, June 08, 2025.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Data Loading and Preprocessing\n",
    "Datasets:\n",
    "cardio_alco.csv: Likely contains alcohol consumption data linked by id, with delimiter=\";\" indicating a semicolon-separated format.\n",
    "cardio_base.csv: Contains cardiovascular health data (e.g., age, weight, height, cholesterol, gender, smoke, ap_hi - systolic blood pressure).\n",
    "covid_data.csv: Contains COVID-19 statistics (e.g., new_cases, new_deaths, population, hospital_beds_per_thousand, gdp_per_capita).\n",
    "Optimization:\n",
    "Dtypes: Specified types (e.g., int32 for id, float32 for weight) reduce memory usage. Nullable types (Int32, Int64) handle NA values in covid_data, which is critical for integer columns with missing data.\n",
    "Low Memory: low_memory=True processes files in chunks, suitable for large datasets.\n",
    "Age Preprocessing: df_cardio_base[\"age\"] = (df_cardio_base[\"age\"] / 365).astype('int32') converts age from days to years, assuming the original data is in days (a common format in health datasets).\n",
    "Potential Insights:\n",
    "The dataset sizes and NA prevalence can be checked with df_cardio_base.info() or df_covid.isna().sum(). Missing values in new_cases or new_deaths might indicate unreported data, affecting aggregates."
